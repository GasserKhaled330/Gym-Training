            </h4>
            <p>
                Upper-lower training splits (2 days upper, 2 days lower) work out to 4 workouts in a 7-day training
                split. Great
                to transition from a 2 or 3 per week full body workout. The <a

                    Training Splits</a> training frequency volume is considered moderate for strength and lean muscle
                gains.

                </span>
            </h4>
            <p>Push/pull/legs is favorite training split which includes pushing muscles (chest, shoulder, triceps),
                the pulling muscles the next (back, biceps, forearms, abs), and lower body (quads, hamstrings,
                glutes,
                calves' w/ abs) on the next day. Add in rest days where needed, all while you donâ€™t miss any days.
                Unlike single
                body part splits, if you miss a <a href="https://legionathletics.com/push-pull-legs/">PPLs
                    workout</a>,
                you'll be able to make it up in 3 days, or simply ad a rest day and stay on the repeating PPL
                pattern. 6 days a week is a lot, but you will add maximum muscle and strength.</p>

                workout
                program for athletes that want to develop strength via heavy compound movements (squats, bench press,
