<h1>
    Split Workout Schedule: What To<br> Know and Examples
</h1>

<section class="what-is-split">
    <h2>What is split workout training?</h2>
    <p>When designing or following a balanced exercise program, it's common to split up your training.</p>
    <p>For example, one way to split up your workout routine is to exercise on some days and rest on others. The
        full-body
        split is an example of this approach.</p>
    <p>You can also divide your training and focus on different body parts or movements on different days. Examples
        of this
        include the upper/lower and the push/pull/legs splits.</p>
    <div class="summary">
        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <P>Split training involves dividing your weekly workout sessions or volume of exercises into separate days
            to focus on
            individual elements.</P>

<section class="benefits">
    <h2>Benefits of split training</h2>
    <p>Splitting up your training gives your body enough time to recover between workouts. It also gives you the
        freedom to
        control the frequency of your training.</p>
    <p>You can also use the method to better target certain muscles or movement patterns when you feel fresh and
        energized at
        the beginning of a workout.</p>
    <p>Research shows that exercise order affects performance over multiple sets. In other words, you might not be
        able to
        train a second movement as hard as your first one. For example, if you squat before bench pressing, you may
        not get the
        most out of your bench press <a
            href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17461391.2020.1733672">(1)</a>.</p>
    <p>So, if your goal is maximum full-body strength, it can make sense to prioritize different exercises on
        separate days.
        Instead of doing a bench press following a squat on the same day, you can do the bench press first on one
        day and the
        squat first on a different day.</p>
    <p>Finally, it can be helpful — both mentally and in terms of energy and recovery — to divide your sessions to
        target one
        body part at a time.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, it can feel like your workouts burn you out or take up too much time per session. This can be
        especially true
        if you're focusing on bodybuilding or performing many different exercises per muscle.</p>
    <p>Keep reading to learn the main ways to split your workout program.</p>
    <div class="summary">
        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <P>Splitting up your training can help you train more days per week while maximizing recovery and strength
            across multiple
            exercises. It also allows for more exercise variety per body part.</P>
